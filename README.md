# Smart Door Lock System Using AVR ATmega 32

This project presents a smart door lock system designed with the AVR ATmega 32 microcontroller, aimed at providing secure access control for educational environments. The system efficiently manages user authentication for students and a professor, ensuring that only authorized individuals can gain access.

## Key Features
- **User Authentication**: The system securely stores names and passwords for each student and the professor, facilitating reliable access control.
- **Dynamic Password Management**: The professor has the capability to update any student's password, offering flexibility and maintaining security.
- **EEPROM Data Storage**: Utilizes EEPROM to ensure that user credentials are retained even during power outages, safeguarding against data loss and reverting to default passwords.

## Technical Overview
The implementation showcases my skills in embedded systems, microcontroller programming, and data management. The project demonstrates a practical approach to secure access control solutions, emphasizing reliability and user-friendly features.
